Description: Non-Linear Robust package is developed to handle the problem of 
    outliers in nonlinear regression,    using robust statistics. It covers 
    classic methods in nonlinear regression as well. It has facilities to fit 
    models in the case of auto correlated and heterogeneous variance cases, 
    while it include tools to detecting outliers in nonlinear regression.
