\details{Weights of chicken randomly selected during the all production period in a chicken breeding farms. Data collected from a chicken breeder chamber, at a local area in Marvdasht at Fars Province of Iran. the beginning population of Flocks was 7300 chicks, at he first 25th dates we have weighted 10 chicken in each date, after that due to wider spread of weight in time, we have collected 20 chicken in each two date. In collecting chickens at each date, we tried to collect completely random data from different part of the chamber.
